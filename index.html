                I still remember the day my parents handed me my first
                cellphone—a
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3310">Nokia 3310</a
                >. As a schoolgirl, I was thrilled yet a little shy about it.
                Back then, mobile phones were a rarity, and having one felt both
                exciting and slightly embarrassing. I would quietly slip it into
                my backpack, unsure of how my classmates would react if they
                knew I had a phone.
              </p>
              <p class="text-p2">
                The Nokia 3310 was a sturdy little device, with its monochrome
                screen and iconic ringtone that echoed through the school
                hallways. I spent hours playing Snake and carefully composing
                text messages, each one a novelty in a world where instant
                communication was still a new concept. It was a time when a
                phone wasn’t just a tool—it was a symbol of something new and
                different.

              Who could have imagined that, just twenty years later or so, we
              would be scrolling through colorful smartphones, surfing the
              internet whenever and wherever we want? The technology that once
              felt so futuristic has become a seamless part of our everyday
              lives. <br />
              But I still look back fondly on that little Nokia, remembering the
              mix of excitement and nervousness that came with it—my first step
              into a connected world that was just beginning to unfold.
